1. 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, ?
Ans . 127
    Explanation: 1+2 =3 , 3+4 = 7, 7+8 = 15, 15+16 = 31, 31+32 = 63, 63+64 = 127.
    
2. 16, 06, 68, 88, ?, 98
Ans. 48
    Explanation: 16-6 = 10, 68-88 = -20(10-30),x-98 = (-20-30)
    which implies x = 98-50 = 48
    
3. In time series data consisting of stock prices what is the dependent and independent
variable?
Ans Price values are dependent variables and Time is an independent variable.

4. 4. For backtesting a trading strategy that involves signals from multiple instruments it is
necessary to make sure that data is __________ correctly. (aligned/scaled
/normalized/formatted).
Ans normalized

5. If I flip a coin five times, what is the probability of a head appearing at least twice?
Ans 0.8125
    Explanation: we need to find the probability of having 2H,3H,4H and 5H and add them together.

6. If I have historical data for the last ten years and want to build a model to predict future
stock prices, should I use all the data to construct the model? Explain your answer.
Ans Predicting stocks prices is a regression problem so ,this historical data can be divided into different sets for training ,validation and testing.

7. Write a SQL query to retrieve a table which gives the name of the school that each
student attends. The retrieved table should have the following columns: StudentID,
StudentName, SchoolName.
Ans select s.StudentID, s.StudentName, c.SchoolName
    from students s
    join schools c
    on s.SchoolID = c.SchoolID
    group by s.StudentID;
    
8. Calculate the time complexity with Big O notation of the following code snippet (n > 0):
i,k=0,0
while i < n:
for j in range(0, 1000000):
while k < n;
print(“Hello World!”)
k += 1
i *= 2
Ans O(n^2)
    Explanantion : Since j is not dependent on n it is assumed to run in constant time .

9. Rank the following curves (red, green, blue) in order of increasing variance?
Ans Green-> Red -> Blue
    Explanation: Relative distance of points from their mean can be considered as an acceptable measure of their variance. Hence green has the least and Blue has the highest variance.
